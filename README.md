jupyter notebooks for post-processing and analysis of airborne/UAS thermal infrared imagery

## Overview
These jupyter notebooks were created for the analysis of specific airborne/UAS thermal infrared (TIR) imagery data, collected in early 2017 at two field sites (Saghen Creek, California, USA; and near Davos Laret, Switzerland). A bias correction method using melting snow at the Sagehen site was applied to the imagery to correct for irregular calibration drift in the uncooled microbolometer TIR cameras.
